          <h1>What to Expect</h1>
          <p>
            Therapy/counseling can be scary. You may find it challenging at
            first to be yourself, thinking you need to put your best foot
            forward. I am not here to judge or critique you. I am here to
            provide a safe space where you can grow and find acceptance and
            comfort.
          </p>
          <p>What you can expect with me as your counselor/therapist:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Challenges to set goals and make progress towards them.</li>
            <li>
              Celebration of the victories and growth, no matter how
              insignificant you may feel they are.
            </li>
            <li>
              Support and guidance, but I can assure you I do not have all the
              answers.
            </li>
            <li>An open-mind and a non-judgmental heart.</li>
            <li>
              An advocate who will consistently promote autonomy and informed
              choice.
            </li>
            <li>
              A safe space where you can be yourself (feel free to swear/curse,
              just let it out).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Growth is uncomfortable. There may be tears, smiles, setbacks, and
            HUGE leaps forward, but no matter what, there will be support.
