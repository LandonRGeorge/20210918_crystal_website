    <h1>What to Expect</h1>
    <p>
      Therapy/counseling can be scary. You may find it challenging at first to
      be yourself, thinking you need to put your best foot forward. I am not
      here to judge or critique you. I am here to provide a safe space where you
      can grow and find acceptance and comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      What you can expect with me as your counselor/therapist:
<ol>
  <li>Challenges to set goals and make progress towards them.</li>
  <li>Celebration of the victories and growth, no matter how insignificant you may feel they are. </li>
  <li>Support and guidance, but I can assure you I do not have all the answers.</li>
  <li>An open-mind and a non-judgmental heart.</li>
  <li>An advocate who will consistently promote autonomy and informed choice. </li>
  <li>A safe space where you can be yourself (feel free to swear/curse, just let it out).</li>
  
</ol>
    </p>
    <p>Growth is uncomfortable. There may be tears, smiles, setbacks, and HUGE leaps forward, but no matter what, there will be support.</p>
