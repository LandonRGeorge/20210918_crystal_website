          <p>
            Counseling can be scary. You may find it challenging at first to be
            yourself, thinking you need to put your best foot forward. I am not
            here to judge or critique you. I am here to provide a safe space
            where you can grow and find acceptance and comfort.Â 
          </p>
          <p>
            Our initial session will be used to discuss your purpose for seeking
            counseling, my role as the therapist, and what you would like to
            achieve in our time together. Relying on Cognitive Behavioral,
            Reality, Solution-Focused, and Person-Centered therapies, strategies
            utilized during sessions may include problem-solving, understanding
            the relationships between beliefs, thoughts, and feelings, as well
            as focusing on the present. Since the sessions are about you, there
            is an expectation you will be actively engaged and willing to do the
            handwork necessary for growth to occur.
          </p>
          <p>What you can expect with me as your therapist:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Challenges to set goals and make progress towards them.</li>
            <li>
              Celebration of the victories and growth, no matter how
              insignificant you may feel they are.
            </li>
            <li>
              Support and guidance, but I can assure you I do not have all the
              answers.
            </li>
            <li>An open-mind and a non-judgmental heart.</li>
            <li>
              An advocate who will consistently promote autonomy and informed
              choice.
            </li>
            <li>
              A safe space where you can be yourself (feel free to swear/curse,
              just let it out).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Growth is uncomfortable. There may be tears, smiles, setbacks, and
            HUGE leaps forward, but no matter what, there will be support.
