            <p>
                As a full-time professional, wife and mother of 3 young kids, I am keenly aware of the
                struggles
                parents face with balancing work/life and the need to remember who we are as individuals.
                Additionally, as
                a
                parent of a child with a congenital heart condition, I am familiar with the need for support
                to
                adjust to a life not previously imagined and how challenging acceptance can be in vulnerable
                moments.
            </p>
            <p>
                My counseling style and strategies have been uniquely shaped by my professional and life
                experiences. Having worked in higher education, non-profit organizations, private and public
                rehabilitation, I have accumulated a wealth of knowledge and skills to serve individuals of
                varied backgrounds and ages. Cognizant of multicultural issues, including race, ethnicity,
                cultural background, disability, and sexual orientation, your treatment plan is individualized to
                meet
                your
                needs. As a longtime social justice advocate, I consider myself an ally to those who feel
                marginalized, discriminated against or forgotten. While I may not understand what life is
                like
                in your shoes, I do have an open heart to hear your story and support you moving forward.
