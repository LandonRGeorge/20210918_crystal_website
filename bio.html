    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>
      As a teenager, I can recall completing a career assessment which indicated
      I should become a counselor. That seemed reasonable - make my own hours,
      listen to people talk, what wouldn’t there be to love about that? But, as
      you know, life happens and I became an angsty teenager, listening to punk
      rock, dreaming of writing articles about bands and traveling the world.
      That didn’t quite pan out, but amid my youth, I found myself eagerly
      wanting to help others. Whether that be listening to my friend’s issues
      and providing support and encouragement, or helping peers with
      disabilities, I found myself drawn to those struggling and searching for
      answers.

      I experienced my first counseling session in college. Life was changing
      quickly, and I was unclear about where I was heading. When I sat down with
      the therapist, I no longer needed to speak about career goals or the
      present, but rather the weight of past events I had been carrying with me
      for decades. It was cathartic and finally gave me a sense of peace. It was
      terrifying, being vulnerable with a stranger, but I trusted her and was
      confident she would provide a safe space for me to be myself and tell my
      story. That is my hope for you. I want you to tell your story and not be
      afraid of judgement. There is no judgement here.

      Fast-forward and here we are. A mother of 3 young kids and a wife, who
      works full-time. A professional attempting to expand her career and attain
      personal and professional goals. In this season of life, I am keenly aware
      of the struggle’s parents face with balancing work/life and the need to
      remember who we are outside of mom/dad/teacher. As a parent of a child
      with a congenital heart condition, I am familiar with the need for support
      to adjust to a life not previously imagined. I have grieved the life I
      thought I would have and accepted the life I do have. I have come to view
      the challenges as just that, challenges which aid us to grow and thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      My counseling style and strategies have been uniquely shaped by life
      experiences and each professional position I have held. Having worked in
      higher education, non-profit, private rehabilitation, and currently as a
      Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor with TWC, I have accumulated a wealth
      of knowledge and skills to serve a variety of individuals. While each
      client’s sessions are individualized, I tend to rely on Cognitive
      Behavioral, Reality, Solution-Focused, and Person-Centered therapies. I
      believe a client should establish goals and my role is to assist in
      achieving them. I am cognizant of multicultural issues and welcome clients
      from all races, ethnicities, cultural backgrounds, and sexual
      orientations. I am open-minded and an ally to those who feel marginalized,
      discriminated against or forgotten. While I may not understand what life
      is like in your shoes, I do have an open-mind and heart to hear your story
      and support you moving forward.
